# epidemic_simulation
This repository contain Python scripts used for educational project of epidemic modelling.

The aim of the project is to create own model of epidemic
During the project we solve following problems:
1) Study Python background which is necessary to simulation
2) Create model according to publications
3) Update model to make it more precise

Python scripts use Python 3.7 and require numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and scipy packages.

epidemic_model.py demonstrate plot of susceptible, infected and removed people dependance on time. rates_variation.py demonstrate plot of infected people dependance on time with different contact rate and illness duration parameters.
